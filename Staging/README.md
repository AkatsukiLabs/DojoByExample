## üëæ Introduction

Dojo Engine is an innovative framework for creating fully on-chain games and provable applications within the Starknet ecosystem. However, due to the novelty of this technology, there are currently few practical examples and clear documentation on how to implement the various components of Dojo in a production environment.

**Dojo by Example** was created to fill this gap by providing detailed and well-documented examples of how to build games and applications using Dojo. This repository will serve as an accessible guide for developers of all levels, making it easier to adopt this technology.

## üèÅ Objective

The main objective of **Dojo by Example** is to provide clear and functional implementations of key elements of Dojo Engine, including:

- Dojo contracts and models.
- Actions and systems within Dojo.
- Connections with the **Cartridge controller**.
- Integrations with other components of the Starknet ecosystem.
- Best practices for developing games and applications in Dojo.

## üî® Importance

Dojo Engine represents a revolution in how on-chain games and autonomous worlds are built. However, the lack of practical examples and well-structured guides makes the learning curve challenging for new developers.

**Dojo by Example** will facilitate this process by providing:

- Functional examples explained step by step.
- Best practices for implementing contracts, systems, and controllers.
- A reference resource for the Starknet developer community.

## üöÄ Purpose

The purpose of this project is to accelerate the adoption of **Dojo Engine** and empower developers to build robust games and applications on Starknet. This will be achieved through well-documented code examples that serve as a reference for anyone interested in developing with this technology.

## üìñ Justification

There are projects in the ecosystem that provide educational examples about Cairo and Starknet, but no specific resource comprehensively covers development with Dojo Engine. Since Dojo introduces a novel paradigm in on-chain game development, having clear documentation and practical examples is essential to guide developers from basic concepts to more advanced implementations.

**Dojo by Example** aims to close this gap by offering educational content and practical examples that allow the community to build provable, composable, and scalable applications on Starknet with ease.

## ‚úÖ Contribute

This project is open to the community. If you have experience developing with **Dojo Engine** and want to contribute with examples, documentation improvements, or feedback, we invite you to collaborate.

With **Dojo by Example**, we aim to make fully on-chain game development more accessible and efficient for all developers. Join us and help build the future of blockchain gaming!

In the future, this tool may be used in Starknet Foundation bootcamps to enable more people to practice and learn how to develop with Dojo Engine.
