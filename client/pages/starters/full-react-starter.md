# Dojo Game Starter Template 🚀

Building onchain games requires integrating many complex pieces: Cairo contracts, React frontends, wallet connections, state management, and deployment pipelines. Instead of spending weeks setting this up from scratch, you can start with a production-ready foundation.

## What is Dojo Game Starter? 🎮

**Dojo Game Starter** is a complete template that provides everything you need to build onchain games on Starknet. It's the same foundation used by successful hackathon teams and game studios to ship games quickly.

**In the box:**
- ✅ Complete React + Dojo integration with TypeScript
- ✅ Cartridge Controller wallet integration  
- ✅ Cairo contracts with player progression system
- ✅ Achievement system implementation
- ✅ Production deployment configurations
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation for extending the game

## Why Use a Template? 🤔

**Time to first playable game:**
- From scratch: 2-4 weeks of setup
- With template: 5 minutes to running game

**What you avoid building:**
- Frontend-blockchain integration patterns
- Wallet connection and session management  
- State management for onchain operations
- Achievement and progression systems
- Deployment pipeline configurations

## Sample Game Mechanics 🎯

The template includes a simple RPG system to demonstrate core patterns:

- **🏋️ Train:** Gain experience (pure advancement)
- **⛏️ Mine:** Earn coins, lose health (risk/reward)  
- **💤 Rest:** Restore health (resource management)

These mechanics teach you how to build any onchain game system.

## Perfect For 🎪

- **Hackathon teams** who need to ship in 48 hours
- **Developers** learning Dojo through hands-on practice
- **Studios** prototyping new game concepts quickly
- **Anyone** who wants to focus on game design, not infrastructure
