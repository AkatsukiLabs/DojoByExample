# Models

Models in Dojo define the structure of your game state and data.

## What are Models?

Models are Cairo structures that represent entities in your game world. They define:

- **State structure** - How data is organized
- **Permissions** - Who can read/write the data
- **Relationships** - How entities connect

## Basic Model Example

```cairo
#[derive(Model, Copy, Drop, Serde)]
struct Player {
    #[key]
    id: u32,
    name: felt252,
    health: u32,
    position: Position,
}

#[derive(Copy, Drop, Serde, Introspect)]
struct Position {
    x: u32,
    y: u32,
}
```

## Key Features

### Primary Keys

Use `#[key]` to mark fields as primary keys:

```cairo
#[derive(Model, Copy, Drop, Serde)]
struct GameSession {
    #[key]
    session_id: u32,
    #[key] 
    player_id: u32,
    score: u32,
}
```

### Derived Traits

Models must implement these traits:
- `Model` - Core Dojo functionality
- `Copy` - For copying values
- `Drop` - For cleanup
- `Serde` - For serialization

## Best Practices

1. **Keep models simple** - One responsibility per model
2. **Use appropriate types** - Choose efficient Cairo types
3. **Design for queries** - Consider how you'll access data
4. **Plan relationships** - Think about entity connections
